# 🐍 Python Fundamentals & Data Structures Mastery

## 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to my Python Learning Journey repository! This comprehensive collection of Python scripts and exercises represents my dedicated effort to master Python programming fundamentals and data structures. Each file in this repository serves as a building block in my journey to becoming a proficient Python developer.

## 📚 What's Inside

### 🏗️ Core Python Concepts
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding Python's dynamic typing system
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, loops (for/while), and logical operations
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code blocks with parameters and return values
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files
- **Built-in Functions**: Leveraging Python's powerful standard library

### 🧮 Data Structures
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pair collections
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements
- **Tuples**: Immutable sequences

### 🛠️ Practical Applications
- **Calculator**: A command-line calculator demonstrating control flow
- **Text Processing**: String manipulation and file operations
- **Data Manipulation**: Working with different data structures

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master Python syntax and best practices
- Understand when and how to use different data structures
- Develop problem-solving skills through practical exercises
- Build a strong foundation for more advanced Python programming
